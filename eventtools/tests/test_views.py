        CALENDAR

        A template tag shows a calendar of eventoccurrences in a given month.

        Calendar's html gives classes for 'today', 'date selection', 'has_events', 'no_events', 'prev_month' 'next_month'.

        Calendar optionally shows days.

        Calendar optionally hides leading or trailing empty weeks.

        Calendar can optionally navigate to prev/next months, which set a start_date to the 1st of the next month.
