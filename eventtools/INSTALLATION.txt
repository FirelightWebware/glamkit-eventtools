0. Install the requirements (using pip).

    pip install -e REQUIREMENTS.txt

1. List the required applications in the ``INSTALLED_APPS`` portion of your settings
   file.  Your settings file might look something like::
   
       INSTALLED_APPS = (
           # ...
           'mptt'
           'eventtools',
           'events',
       )

2. Install the pagination middleware.  Your settings file might look something
   like::
   
       MIDDLEWARE_CLASSES = (
           # ...
           'pagination.middleware.PaginationMiddleware',
       )

3. Define models. In your new app:

    * Define a model that subclasses models.EventModel.
    
    * In EventMeta, define the fields that you want to be automatically inherited by children (children_inherit)

    * You can also rename the manager, by default called `eventobjects`.

    * Define a model that subclasses models.OccurrenceModel. Give it a FK to the 1st model called 'event' that has a related name 'occurrences'
    

4. Set up admin:
        Event registered with EventAdmin
