MODEL
Is using trees for eventvariations AND parent/child sustainable?
Maybe some sort of EventTemplate model instead?

Migrate Occurrence and corresponding Generator fields to
    start_date
    start_time
    duration_days
    duration_minutes
to reduce cognitive complexity, potential for validationerrors, and 'magic' in
updating generators.

Change Generator repeat_until to be a date only (since only one occurrence per
day is generated).

FRONT END
Prettify templates a bit: Use http://cssgrid.net/ for more flexible layout?
Tabs for today/tomorrow/this weekend/etc.
List events only for a specific date (for institutions that have enough events)
Resurrect iCal.

ADMIN
Resurrect the view for all occurrences, distinguishing generated or not
Resurrect the behaviour where deleted generated occurrences are added as an Exception.
Tooltips for fields in inline admin forms.

UNDER THE HOOD
Improve performance
Consistent api for dateranges/pprint_date.
Put utils.domain into glamkit-convenient, or replace with another technique?
Patch Django to provide instance to callable for default.
PEP-8 compliance
